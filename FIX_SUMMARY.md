# Fix Summary: TypeError fetch failed

## Problem

Your app was crashing with `TypeError: fetch failed` at `getAllCompanions` because:

1. Supabase queries were failing (likely missing database tables)
2. No error handling - any Supabase error would crash the entire page
3. Clerk JWT template "supabase" wasn't configured, causing auth to fail

## What I Fixed

### 1. Added Robust Error Handling

**Files changed:**

- `lib/supabase.ts` - Added env validation, graceful auth fallback
- `lib/actions/companion.actions.ts` - Added error logging, return empty arrays instead of throwing
- `app/page.tsx` - Wrapped DB calls in try/catch, show empty states gracefully

### 2. Made Supabase Client More Resilient

- Validates env vars before creating client
- Falls back to anon key if Clerk auth fails
- Logs helpful error messages for debugging

### 3. Prevented Page Crashes

- Home page now handles missing data gracefully
- Shows "No companions available yet" instead of crashing
- Both `getAllCompanions` and `getRecentSessions` errors are caught

### 4. Created Database Setup Guide

- New file: `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` with:
  - Complete SQL for all required tables
  - RLS policies for security
  - Sample data seeding
  - Troubleshooting tips

## Next Steps for You

### 1. Create Your Database Tables (REQUIRED)

Your Supabase database is empty. You need to create tables:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://dnuoshqyxfmjjftzbpiz.supabase.co
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL from `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` (3 tables: companions, session_history, bookmarks)

### 2. Test Your App

```powershell
# Dev server is already running at http://localhost:3000
# Visit it in your browser
```

You should now see:

- ‚úÖ No more 500 errors
- ‚úÖ Page loads (may show "No companions available yet")
- ‚úÖ Helpful console logs if something goes wrong

### 3. Optional: Configure Clerk + Supabase Auth

If you want user-specific RLS:

1. Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí JWT Templates ‚Üí Create "supabase" template
2. Follow Clerk's Supabase integration docs
3. Update RLS policies to use Clerk's user ID

### 4. For Production (Vercel)

Before deploying:

1. ‚úÖ Create the database tables in Supabase
2. ‚úÖ Set all environment variables in Vercel
3. ‚úÖ Use production Clerk keys (not test keys)
4. ‚úÖ Seed some initial companion data

## What You'll See Now

### In Terminal (Dev Mode)

```
Creating Supabase client without auth
Supabase getAllCompanions error: { code: '42P01', message: 'relation "companions" does not exist' }
Failed to fetch companions: Error: Failed to fetch companions: relation "companions" does not exist
```

This is GOOD - it means:

- ‚úÖ Environment variables are working
- ‚úÖ Supabase connection is working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You just need to create the tables

### In Browser

- Page loads successfully
- Shows "No companions available yet" (because tables don't exist)
- No more crashes or 500 errors

## Files Modified

1. `lib/supabase.ts` - Better error handling, graceful auth fallback
2. `lib/actions/companion.actions.ts` - Error logging, safe returns
3. `app/page.tsx` - Try/catch wrappers, empty state UI
4. `next.config.ts` - Fixed image remotePatterns (added protocol)
5. `components/CompanionComponent.tsx` - Fixed regex typo
6. `components/CompanionCard.tsx` - Fixed "Launch" typo
7. `components/CompanionForm.tsx` - Fixed "Session" and "minutes" typos
8. `app/companions/[id]/page.tsx` - Fixed params type, "minutes" typo
9. `app/companions/page.tsx` - Fixed searchParams type
10. `types/index.d.ts` - Fixed SearchParams type

## New Files Created

1. `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` - Complete database setup guide
2. `.env.example` - Template with placeholders (for sharing/onboarding)
